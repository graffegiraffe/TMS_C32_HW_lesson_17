# Here, the following tasks are implemented:
## Task 1:
Create a generalized functional interface.
Write a class with one method.
In this method, implement the logic:
- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with a string type and pass the logic of reversing the string (outputting the string in reverse order) to the interface method.

- if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with an integer type and pass the logic of finding the factorial of the number to the interface method.

## Task 2:
Get day of week by date + implemented what day of the year it is
